## Some ideas
Ideas we want to implement in the future, but did not have enough time to implement or work out completely.

- update decks and keep learning progress
- extend format and displaying in app to show not only simple text
  - Markdown support
  - formulas similar to LaTeX
  - image support
  - suggested answers to choose from (quiz-like, see below)
- deck library, recommended decks
- optimize random card selection algorithm + make it customizable in app settings
- import decks from a website even if no CORS headers are sent, see [no-cors.md](no-cors.md)
- analytics for insights into individial learning progress
- internationalization
- light color mode
- see also [monetization.md](monetization.md)
- sync learning progress across multiple devices

## _FFQuiz_ - Fancy FlashQuiz

The following idea will be its own project, but we still want you to know what it's about.
The _FFQuiz_ is a quiz game using the foundation of FFC focused on the gamification of learning.
With FFQuiz we want to expand the use cases for FFC and make learning more enjoyable and accessible for younger and older generations.
The Quiz should be easy to set up and work for 2 or more players.

The game will consist of different rounds and quiz styles.
Players will be competing against one another in some kind of game show you tend to see on TV.
Depending on the number of players you will face of against one or more of your friends.
To help encourage you to use the app each player will get a score and the one with the most knowledge will be ranked first.

We can also spin this idea further in building an ecosystem of apps that all aim to help learning.
For example we could add a _FFHelp_ app which allowes users to communicate across the globe and share their knowledge or some sort of _Wiki_ for schools or universities in certain districts to help them educate students.
The possibilities to improve and expand these ideas is sheer endless.
