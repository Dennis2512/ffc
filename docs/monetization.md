# Monetization

Sooner or later every app publisher thinks about monetization in some form.
A vast majority chooses an ad based monetization system.
On the one hand that doesn't make much sense because we prefer an open source model and anyone could fork the repository and diable ads.
On the other hand users can easily install addons in their browsers to block ads.
Additionally such an ad based monetization system often leads to an app with around 50% of the available display area filled with ads.
Because of this many users despise this sort of monetization and will opt to other apps instead, especially if the app has a small user base or is easily replaceable.
We try to combat this with a few ideas of our own.

## Educational App

Our first idea is about education and ability to easily access it.
Because of this we want to create specialized versions of the app with pre-installed decks or deck selection menus for every customer.
Customers can be private companies and public institutions like schools or universities that pay a comparably small fee to have this web app adjusted to their needs and get help rolling it out.
This repository being open source and under the MIT License will also be available for those customers to adjust on their own without any cost connected to it.
Our goal with this is to accumulate more users and introduce the app as the de facto standard for educational purposes.

How does it work though?
It's pretty simple, we create a deck selection instead of the deck creator on the import page.
This deck selection will be fed by a JSON file hosted by us or the company/school and will include all decks created by the school.
Users will simply choose a deck they want and add it to their own collection.
To avoid misuse we could disable the URL import and only allow users to choose the given decks.

Ease of use is the focus of an educational app and users should enjoy using it.
Because of this our long term goal would be to enable the app to be used for educational purposes simply by submitting a code created for your company or school.
With this idea we eliminate the need of specialized apps as well as a lot of support and thus lower the cost of development in the long term.

## Curated Decks

Another monetization idea are curated decks.
With curated decks we create a space for companies and users to get their decks featured and seen by every user in the app.
These decks will use the same deck selection as the educational app proposes.
This kind of deck library will use a static url to get possible decks that we think are worth your time or have a sponsor and are not contrary to public morality.

In the end we might offer others the possibility to sell decks to users for a small fee so that we can get a commission every time someone buys a deck.
This would also help to generate income without the need to maintain a large pool of staff members.
If we give users the opportunity to earn money with our app, they will do their part to make the app successful and boost their and thus our profits.

A deck library is one of the few things we want to add in the future and can be used in many different ways, so curated decks could be the first monetization idea we try.

## Arrange contact to private tutors

We also thought about some model similar to ads but more focused on the subject of learning.
Users could give their consent to see suitable private tutors for certain subjects they are struggling with.
We could then get a small commision for connecting students with a tutor.
This can also be used together with our educational app approach where older students could offer help for younger ones.
This would also have the advantage that subjects are specific for one institution/school.

## Closing Words

The app will always be open source and free for everyone to fork and create an own version improving what we created.
Because of this we encourage everyone to contribute to this repository in order to create the best application possible.

Ads keep getting more intrusive and are used to get a perfect digital copy of you to target you with even more specialized ads.
We believe apps should not see users as the product they are trying to sell to customers (e.g. advertisers) and that is why we do not want to incorporate any sort of ads in our design.
With our design the focus is shifted to the users anonymity and safety.
They should feel free to learn new or improve their skills.
The constant fear of collecting personalized data and the misuse of it will hinder their learning ability and thus be contraproductive for our purpose.
