# Design

The design of the app was chosen by us developers, because we are the first users of our app.
We decided to use an overall darkmode for the app to reduce eye strain when learning in the evening or in dark environments.

Every aspect of the app is designed to support one hand use no matter the screen size.
We added the ability to swipe to the right to open the menu and added different design elements (like our logo) at certain locations to naturally move the complete user interaction to the bottom half of the screen. (This aspect is easily seen in the learning process.)

We also decided to use Vuetify and the material design provided by it.
This made development easier and quicker, because we could use already existing code and did not have to create our own templates.
