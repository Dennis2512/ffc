- easier for others to contribute because easy to understand
- community backed
- lightweight
- easy to expand
- supports TypeScript, thus taking advantage of typing and static code checks

## Why Vuetify?

- many UI components for Material Design
- widely used
- well documented

## LocalStorage for storing data

- easiest to store data client-side
- we just need a simple way of storing key-value-pairs -> local storage offers exactly this without any overhead
