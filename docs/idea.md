# The idea behind Fancy Flashcard

Fancy Flashcard (FFC) originated from the idea of combining the ease of use of index cards and their flexibility.
With physical index cards you can simply mix the learning decks you want, no matter the topic.
We tried to do the same with FFC by allowing the user to combine two or more decks for a learning session.

To us this is a kind of small revolution for digital learning and the concept of a paperless and therefore more environmently oriented world.
We want to shift the focus away from writing thousands of index cards in schools or universities every year and instead embrace the digital world and its possibilities.
With FFC you can easily create decks and share them with your friends.
This will not only make your life easier, because you don't need to write every index card yourself or use a copier to be able to share your decks, it will also make the learning process more social, because you can simply use the decks in learning games.

Because of the simple structure of our decks they can be easily integrated in all sort of apps.
This is where we see one of the best parts of e-learning.
The ability to cooperate with others in e.g. quiz games where you and your friends compete.
Especially in a global crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, digitial learning is one of the most important achievements in modern history.
With FFC we try to give people the opportunity to educate themselves in their own homes and help the young generation to be able to learn everywhere they want for as long as they want.

To sum it up, FFC is as good as physical index cards but you will not have to carry the cards with you to be able to learn on your commute to school/work or when you have a few minutes of free time and don't know what to do.
