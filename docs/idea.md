# The idea behind Fancy Flashcard

Fancy Flashcard (FFC) originated from the idea of combining the ease of use of index cards and their flexibility.
With normal index cards you can simply mix the learning decks you want, no matter the topic.
We tried to do the same with FFC by allowing the user to combine two or more decks for a learning session.
